# Personal Portfolio 
Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This represents my first attempt to develop a web-based portfolio, in which I showcase my skills and works related to web development and UI/UX design.

## 📝 Description
This portfolio is a single-page website, hand-coded using HTML and CSS. The design layout was crafted in Adobe XD. Here are some of the standout features:<br><br>

#### Hero section with navigation
A full-width header combined with smooth navigation. Click on a navigation item, and it seamlessly scrolls you to the respective section.<br><br>

## ♿ Accessibility
I'm an advocate for digital inclusivity. With that in mind, this portfolio is built with semantic HTML structures, enhanced with `alt` and `aria-label` attributes to boost accessibility.
